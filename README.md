SQL n Knaves
==============

Answers to prompts given for undisclosed reason. 

###Prompt 1
SQL query can be found in currency.sql 

###Prompt 2
Python code found in cards/ and unit tests in tests/ 
demo.py is a small script which prints some output and displays some Card handling features of the Deck. 

Nosetests will cleanly run all tests.

I doubt this will ever get added to PyPi so I'm not going to bother with a setup.py file.
